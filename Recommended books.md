Anything that goes in here is something I actually read, from start to finish. Obviously, I won't be covering books which are related to fiction, drama or whatever.

My way of reading is through Kindle or physical books (if available), and while I always try to go for English-only books, sometimes I only get the Spanish version (mainly for physical ones) due to where I live (and the price of the ones in English!).

- _It Worked for Me: In Life and Leadership_ by Colin Powell
	- Main topic: **Life lessons and leadership principles**
	- Author is a formet US Secretary of State and general. It covers his career with emphasis on integrity, preparation, working hard, and being responsible.
	- I got to this book after an "all hands" call on a company I worked for. Our VP mentioned some principles and then made a mention to the author. I was quite surprise when reading about his life and the book overall is really good.
- *The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win* by Gene Kim
	- Main topic is around **DevOps and IT Transformation**
	- The next one, The Unicorn Project is good, but my take is to read this one first.
- *Revenge of the tipping point* by Malcolm Gladwell
	- Main topic is around **How Ideas Spread and Gain Momentum**
	- Provides really good examples how ideas spread and what we should be looking for when trying to achieve (almost) massive adoption of something (as well as how it can backfire, example of the "perfect" school that he mentions)
- _Beyond Blame_ by Dave Zwieback
	- Main topic: **Blameless Culture and Systems Thinking in Problem Solving**
	- It is a good kind-of guide on fostering collaboration and continuous improvement in teams
- _The Delicate Art of Bureaucracy_ by Mark Schwartz
	- Main topic: **Agility and Innovation around Bureaucracy**
	- The term Bureaucracy is coined to bad things. The author brings a new perspective to it, and explains how we got to it and how we can make the future more bright for this topic (in the sense of innovating and allowing the bureaucracy to actually help us).
- _Decoding Greatness: How the Best in the World Reverse Engineer Success_ by Ron Friedman
	- Main topic: **Reverse Engineering Success to Unlock Mastery**
	- It's a good book but you need to open your mind a lot. It provides a lot of references to learn from, focusing on mastering any field.
	- I would say it gives you a lot of ideas around how to set your own goals into achieving mastery.
- _The Bezos Blueprint_ by Carmine Gallo
	- Main topic: **Communication Strategies for Leadership and Innovation**
	- It is obvious that it goes through Jeff Bezos life, and how his communication style was crucial for Amazon.
	- Talks on storytelling, 6-page memos, future press release
- _War and Peace and IT_ by Mark Schwartz
	- Main topic: **Aligning IT with Business Strategy and Innovation**
	- Great book on how IT role has evolved. It is not useful for current IT context, but helps to get some idea on how we got here.
- _Rebel Talent: Why It Pays to Break the Rules at Work and in Life_ by Francesca Gino
	- Main topic: **Harnessing Nonconformity for Innovation and Growth**
	- I loved this one, they focus on those "rebels" (I like to believe I'm one) that challenge norms and embrace curiosity.
	- The author makes a complex topic easy to read.
- *Permission to Screw Up: How I Learned to Lead by Doing (Almost) Everything Wrong* by Kristen Hadeed
	- Main topic is around **Leadership**
	- A lot of insight in making mistakes and how to learn on the go
	- Gives quite a lot of good references to other books and ways of handling some topics ([FBI, Feeling, Behavior, Impact](https://www.kristenhadeed.com/blog/why-is-accepting-feedback-so-dang-hard)), 360 reviews, among others
