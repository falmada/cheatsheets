If you don't give someone the right information, you're setting them up to fail.

Here are the 5 key things to communicate every time you delegate a specific task. 
1. **Output/end result**: Specify what 'done' and 'good' looks like 
2. **Purpose:** (aka the 'Commander's Intent) What is the point of task? This gives them a north star to follow when they face decision points.
3. **Inputs**: What do they need to succeed? Eg. you'll need this data, read this article, speak to this person
4. **Constraints**: Budget, timeline, and scope are all essential parameters. E.g. you can't spend more than $x, the deck must be max 10 slides, etc.
5. **Next steps**: Usually this is defining a check-in point, e.g. "Schedule 30 minutes for us to review on Thursday afternoon".

Talk this through in person or on a call, then send a follow-up email for easy reference.

Do this well, and the person will a) understand the task and b) see where they're free to make decisions themselves.

Writing out these 5 steps is also a forcing function to make sure you're clear on what you want done.
