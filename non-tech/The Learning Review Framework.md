1. Set the context
	1. [More info](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beyond-blame/9781491914441/ch18.html)
2. Build a timeline
	1. What happened from the perspective of the individuals involved
		1. what did the know at that time
		2. when
		3. how did it make sense to them (at that time)
	2. Be careful on counterfactuals
	3. Describe what happened, don't explain
	4. Encourage and note divergent/dissenting opinions
3. Determine and prioritize remediation items, if any. 
	1. This can be done separately from building a timeline
4. Publish the learning review write-up as widely as possible

Sample questions to ask (during the session) to get more info:
- Did we know this at the time or is it obvious only in hindsight?
- When did we learn this fact?
- Can you please describe what happened without explaining (too much)?
- This sounds like a counterfactual. What actually happened, what did w know, and how did it make sense at the time?
